# Obsidian Reference Manager (ORM)
Most people rely on another reference manager (e.g. Zotero, Jabref) in order to cite in Obsidian. However, not only are the syncing process cluncky and unreliable, but the bibliography data also remain inaccessible by the Obsidian ecosystem (for instance, if one wants to query them using Dataview). After reviewing the documentations, I think that Obsidian can totally be its own reference manager, and one even more powerful and well integrated into an academic workflow. This project serves to validate such a hypothesis.

# Principles and Features
- Each reference exist as a page, like an index card. This way, references can be easily linked to pages and files in Obsidian, and they can be easily queried via Dataview.
- Citing basically becomes a Dataview query. In fact, users can do a lot more than citation.
  (I origianlly planned to convert Bib to JSON and work on the JSON directly in Javascript. It would be easy for developers, but only by using Dataview would the reference data become fully accessible to the users.)
- Reference pages can be automatically generated by improrting a .bib file, so one doesn't have to work all the way from sctatch if they already have a database.
- Similarly, .bib file can be easily generated from reference pages via an export. This is not needed if one writes and cites exclusively within Obsidian. This is only needed if one needs to write and cite elsewhere or eventually convert Markdown to another format via Pandoc, for instance.
