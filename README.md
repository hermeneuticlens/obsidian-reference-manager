# Obsidian Reference Manager (ORM)
Most people rely on another reference manager (e.g. Zotero, Jabref) in order to cite in Obsidian. However, not only are the syncing process cluncky and unreliable, but the bibliography data also remain inaccessible by the Obsidian ecosystem (for instance, if you want to query them using Dataview). After reviewing the documentations, I think that Obsidian can totally be its own reference manager, and one even more powerful and well integrated into an academic workflow. This project serves to validate such a hypothesis.

# Principles and Features
- Each reference exist as a page, like an index card. This way, references can be easily linked to pages and files in Obsidian, and they can be easily queried via Dataview.
- Citing basically becomes a Dataview query.
- Reference pages can be automatically generated by improrting a .bib file, so you don't have to work all the way from sctatch.
- Similarly, .bib file can be easily generated from reference pages via an export. This is not needed if you write and cite within Obsidian. This is only needed if you need to write and cite elsewhere or if you eventually need to convert your work to another format via Pandoc, for instance.
